Sum Root to Leaf Numbers 

Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf 
path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 
123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

For example,

    1
   / \
  2   3
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.

Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

Symmetric Tree

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric 
around its center).

For example, this binary tree is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
But the following is not:
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \

Validate Binary Search Tree 

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's 
key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the 
node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
